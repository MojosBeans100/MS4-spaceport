                <p>Adam owns a mountain bike shop in Dunkeld, Scotland and is heavily involved in local trail
                    maintenance.
                    The mountain bike industry is growing rapidly in the small community, and officials must respond
                    to the
                    demand for new trails, and keeping current trails safe.
                </p>

                <p>Adam uses our platform to search for images of the surrounding hills and forestry areas, and the
                    trail

                    committee
                    members are sent onto the hills to walk many kilometers of trails in person.
                    The images can show detail of windfall, deforestation, broken features and scope for new

                    health or changes.
                    An interval of one month (i.e. one image per month) is suitable for this kind of pipeline, as
                    vegetation

                <p>Since satellites became equipped to measure sea level, sea surface temperatures, sea-ice
                    fluctuation and vegetation coverage, they have been instrumental in providing environmental
                    scientists with information about the rise in sea temperatures and reduction of polar ice.
                </p>

                <p>Changes in the landscape can be detected either via comparing images taken with extended periods of
                    time between the image capture time, or via the difference in measured light reflection. Snow and
                    ice have a high light reflection index, meaning infrared images taken of the specified region will
                    show differences if the ice level has reduced.
                </p>

                <p>This provides insight into our understanding of ice reduction and overall global warming of the

                    <td>The AOI coverage refers to the percentage of the AOI which was selected which could be captured
                        by
                        satellite imaging technology. If a satellite does not have 100% field of vision of the selected
                        AOI,
                        only a portion of that AOI can be captured.<br>
                        All pipelines created on our platform gurantee that all images will have captured at least 50%
                        of
                        the AOI selected.</td>

                        be
                        'called' by another platform to provide data. Spaceport uses the Skywatch API to match up your

                        m
                        area on the ground. <br>Images available to the users on this platform will have a resolution

                        Any images delivered to your pipeline will provide a relevant link with all the metadata for
                        that
                        image. This data is used when post processing the image for whatever the purpose may be.</td>

                        differences on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere. <br>

                        In this context, we are looking for satellite images between two dates, hopefully delivering
                        results
                        within specified intervals.<br>It is similar to a project timeline, with defined goals along the
                        way
                        to be met by specific dates.</td>

                        match up
                        to the most suitable satellite.<br>
                        Satellites follow a specific trajectory around the Earth, therefore the API cross references the
                        selected AOI with any satellites orbiting above that AOI. Satellites also have a limited
                        footprint
                        (area of the Earth's surface which is visible to them).<br>
                        If the satellite orbits above the AOI within the prescribed interval, and can meet all other
                        parameter requirements, this is successful satellite aquisition.<br>

                        every
                        day. The longer the interval, the higher chance an image can be found for that interval, as
                        there is
                        less restriction on when the image can be taken and by which satellite.</td>

        <div class="purpose-section">
            <h3 id="discover-faq-title">FAQ</h3>
            <p>Here are some frequently asked questions about our platform.</p>

            <h5>How can I receive images straight away?</h5>
            <p>If you'd like to start collecting images immediately, you can set up your pipeline to look for archived
                imagery - images from the past. The platform will deliver these as soon as they are gathered and
                processed.</p>

            <h5>My pipeline starts and finishes in the past, why is it still 'active'?</h5>
            <p>Satellite imagery retrieval can take a few minutes. If your pipeline is still active, it is likely still
                either retrieving, processing or formatting the images. You are recommended to allow a few minutes for
                this process, and
                welcome to update the pipeline until complete.</p>

            <h5>Why are some of my images taken in the day, and some at night?</h5>
            <p>As long as the images have been captured within the specified interval, they will be delivered. If the
                interval is set to 1 day, the image could have been captured at any time within those 24 hours, day and
                night. Intervals cannot be set to more specific times, such as within the hour or minute.</p>

            <h5>Why was my pipeline unsuccessful in delivering images?</h5>
            <p>Successful retrieval of images depends on many factors. Most importantly, in order to capture an image of
                the area selected (AOI), a satellite must be scheduled to have the area in their field of vision within
                the specified interval dates. We do not have 100% satellite coverage of Earth, therefore it is entirely
                possible for the AOI to not have coverage by any satellites within the interval timeframe. We recommend
                increasing the interval period
                and maximising the AOI for a higher probability of satellite aquisition, and therefore delivered
                results.</p>

            <h5 id="#discover-use-images">What can I do with my satellite images?</h5>
            <p>Spaceport is a website designed to provoke curiosity in those unfamiliar with satellite imagery. If you
                have an interest in using the images for a specific purpose, you can:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>- compare all images from the same pipeline, to distinguish changes in the environment</li>
                    <li>- browse the metadata for technical information about the images</li>
                    <li>- download the images and apply standard image processing techniques, such as increasing or
                        decreasing
                        the exposure, contrast, saturation,
                        and hue, to determine if you can enhance the image</li>
                    <li>- satellite imagery is cool - share them with your friends!</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <h5>Which satellites does the platform use to collect images?</h5>
            <p>Spaceport has access to the Sentinel-2 (ESA), PlanetScope (Planet), SPOT (Airbus), Skysat (Planet),
                Kompsat-3 (SIIS), and Pleiades (Airbus) satellite data.</p>

            <h5>Why are my images blurry when I zoom in?</h5>
            <p>In order to offer free satellite imagery, Spaceport can only access 'low resolution' data, representing
                an image resolution of 8 - 15 metres. A
                resolution of 8 metres means that each pixel on the image represents an area on Earth of 8 metres
                squared. If the image has captured an area of 5,000 km<sup>2</sup>, that is a very large area on Earth
                to capture in an image which is a size that could be rendered on a computer screen, so we have to
                sacrifice
                some image quality. The images can still
                be useful and interesting to look at, and higher resolution images can be purchased on other websites.
