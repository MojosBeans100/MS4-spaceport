                        Satellites follow a specific trajectory around the Earth, therefore the API cross references the
                        selected AOI with any satellites orbiting above that AOI. Satellites also have a limited
                        footprint

            <h3 id="discover-faq-title">FAQ</h3>
            <p>Here are some frequently asked questions about our platform.</p>

            <h5>My pipeline starts and finishes in the past, why is it still 'active'?</h5>
            <p>Satellite imagery retrieval can take a few minutes. If your pipeline is still active, it is likely still
                either retrieving, processing or formatting the images. You are recommended to allow a few minutes for
                this process, and
                welcome to update the pipeline until complete.</p>

            <h5>Why are some of my images taken in the day, and some at night?</h5>
            <p>As long as the images have been captured within the specified interval, they will be delivered. If the
                interval is set to 1 day, the image could have been captured at any time within those 24 hours, day and
                night. Intervals cannot be set to more specific times, such as within the hour or minute.</p>

            <h5>Why was my pipeline unsuccessful in delivering images?</h5>
            <p>Successful retrieval of images depends on many factors. Most importantly, in order to capture an image of
                the area selected (AOI), a satellite must be scheduled to have the area in their field of vision within
                the specified interval dates. We do not have 100% satellite coverage of Earth, therefore it is entirely
                possible for the AOI to not have coverage by any satellites within the interval timeframe. We recommend
                increasing the interval period
                and maximising the AOI for a higher probability of satellite aquisition, and therefore delivered
                results.</p>

            <h5 id="#discover-use-images">What can I do with my satellite images?</h5>
            <p>Spaceport is a website designed to provoke curiosity in those unfamiliar with satellite imagery. If you
                have an interest in using the images for a specific purpose, you can:
                - compare all images from the same pipeline, to distinguish changes in the environment<br>
                - browse the metadata for technical information about the images<br>
                - download the images and apply standard image processing techniques, such as increasing or decreasing
                the exposure, contrast, saturation,
                and hue, to determine if you can enhance the image quality
            </p>

            <h5>Which satellites does the platform use to collect images?</h5>
            <p>Spaceport has access to the Sentinel-2 (ESA), PlanetScope (Planet), SPOT (Airbus), Skysat (Planet),
                Kompsat-3 (SIIS), and Pleiades (Airbus) satellite data.</p>
