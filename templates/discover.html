                    date, involving a series of stages.<br>
                    In this context, we are looking for satellite images between two dates, hopefully delivering results
                    within specified intervals.<br>It is similar to a project timeline, with defined goals along the way to be met by specific dates.</td>

                <td>AOI</td>
                <td>The AOI, or Area of Interest, is the determined location on the surface of the Earth, of which you
                    hope to receive satellite images.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>AOI coverage</td>

                    satellite imaging technology.<br>
                    All pipelines created on our platform gurantee that all images will have captured at least 50% of
                    the AOI selected.</td>

                    intervals which will start and finish before today will deliver archived images.  These can be delivered straight away.</td>

                    scheduled for any time after today.</td>

                    to the most suitable satellite.<br>
                    Satellites follow a specific trajectory around the Earth, therefore the API cross references the
                    selected AOI with any satellites orbiting above that AOI.<br>
                    If the satellite orbits above the AOI within the prescribed interval, and can meet all other
                    parameter requirements, this is successful satellite aquisition.</td>

                <td>Tasking interval</td>
                <td>The interval is the length of time between two dates. There will be several intervals within the
                    pipeline. If the interval is set to one day, the user wishes to capture an image of that AOI every
                    day.  The longer the interval, the higher chance an image can be found for that interval, as there is less restriction on when the image can be taken and by which satellite.</td>

                    example, infrared satellite imagery can be used for global warming projects, to capture temperature
                    differences on the Earth's surface and in the atmosphere. </td>

                Any images delivered to your pipeline will provide a relevant link with all the metadata for that image.  This data is used when post processing the image for whatever the purpose may be.</td>
