# Spaceport
Spaceport is a full stack website which allows users to access satellite imagery of the Earth.  Users can create a tasking pipeline which will deliver images of the specified area when they are available.  The website was developed for Milestone 4 as part of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Developement.
