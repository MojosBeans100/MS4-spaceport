# Project Overview
- This website was developed for submission as the Milestone 4 project of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development.
- The website is deployed using the Heroku pages at the following url: https://ms4spaceport.herokuapp.com/
- The repository on Github that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url: https://github.com/MojosBeans100/ms4-spaceport
- The website was built with a responsive look and feel, designed to be enjoyable to use on all screen sizes.

## Technical Abstract
This project has been designed to provide users with a platform to access satellite imagery through the Skywatch ‘Application Programming Interface’ (or ‘API’). The project idea was initially proposed by a company called Astrosat (Scotland) who specialise in data visualisation of satellite images to enhance our understanding of the challenges we face on Earth.

Satellite imagery is becoming increasingly popular as a way of providing a different perspective on changing environments on the Earth's surface. For example, images taken by satellites can provide a more expansive view of rainforest deforestation in the Amazon, enabling more straightforward and accurate calculations of the proportion the total area that is felled, as well as the rate of destruction. Environmental organisations can thus utilise this technology to draw attention to decline in critical climactic environments.

*Landsat 9 satellite image of the Coronation Islands of Western Australia*

Satellite imagery is also becoming more accessible to the global citizenry, whose uses for it range from specific projects to simple curiosity. In recognition that there are many who are interested in, but hitherto unfamiliar with, satellite technology, the website attempts to provide a comprehensive and accessible guide through the process.

The [Skywatch](https://www.skywatch.com/) ‘Application Programming Interface’ (or ‘API’) requires users to submit details of the satellite images they wish to access, defining within specific parameters. The API will then cross-reference these with the satellites available on its database, with the goal of straightforwardly delivering the desired images to the user.

While Astrosat regularly use the Skywatch EarthCache console to retrieve images, the company has less experience in interacting with the API itself.  This project attempts to provide insight into the intricacies of the API and to provide a user-friendly, front-end platform to demonstrate its capabilities.  

# Access
The assessor can create their own account to test the functionality of the website, and/or can use the details provided in the project milestone submission form to view some example pipelines which have been created for convenience.

# Definitions
This website is based on a technical concept of accessessing satellite imagery, therefore see below some useful definitions which may be used in this document. These definitions and more can also be found on the Discover website page.

- Pipeline: a pipeline refers to the timeline, or projected plan or schedule, of receiving satellite images. Each object in the 'List' model represents a pipeline.  Pipelines are 'active' if they have not completed all intervals, and 'complete' if all intervals have been completed

- Interval: the interval describes the time period in which to look for images.  An interval of 1 day will aim to deliver 1 image per day; an interval of bi-weekly will aim to deliver 1 image every 14 days.

- AOI:  the Area of Interest, or AOI, is the area/coverage/footprint on Earth of which the user wishes to collect images

# UX
## Strategy
### Site User
The primary goals of the website user are as follows:
- To create an account on the website, which will allow them to create pipelines
- To create, update, edit and delete pipelines 
- To view the details of a pipeline they have created
- To view the schedule of receiving images
- To see a list of all their pipelines, ordered by status
- To understand the applications and purposes of satellite imagery

### Admin User
The primary goals of the website owner or admin are as follows:
- To view a list of all pipelines created
- To view a list of all results created
- To delete pipelines (API restriction does not allow > 100 pipelines under the developer's account, therefore 'complete' pipelines would have to be deleted if the number of total pipelines was approaching 100)

[Back to top](#spaceport)

## Structure
### Pages
The website has five main pages, with user authentication on three:
- Homepage (all): to introduce users to the website and detail the purpose
- Discover (all): to allow users to explore the uses of satellite imagery
- My Pipelines (user): to list all pipelines created by the user
- View of pipeline (user): to display all details of the pipeline instance
- Create pipeline (user): to display an interactive form for creating a pipeline

The additional pages are as follows:
- Edit pipeline: for users to edit pipeline details
- Delete pipeline: for users to delete pipelines
- Confirmation of deleted pipeline: to confirm the deletion of a pipeline
- Log in/log out/sign up pages: for user to be able to sign in/up/out

The website was designed to be simple, clear and uncluttered, basic in structure, with attractive images of satellites and images captured by satellites.
Bootstrap was used to aid responsiveness, as well as media queries in CSS.

### Database

- Spaceport App
- templates
- static
- README
- manage.py
- Procfile
- Requirements.txt

#### Database Model

![Schema](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643821929/Spaceport/SCHEMA_j2yy7r.jpg)

*Database schema*

#### Models
There are three models in this project.  As the project uses an API for a lot of the information stored in the databases, see the associated tables to understand how the data is created (whether by the User, the Spaceport app, or from the API)

##### User
- The User model contains information about the user, as part of the Django allauth library
- No additional features are added to this model, as a basic username and password satisfy the requirements of the project
- The 'email address' field was deemed not necessary for this project and was thus removed from the Sign Up form. See [Unfixed Bugs](#unfixed-bugs).

##### List
- The List model contains information about the pipeline the user set up
- The model fields are as below:

| Field | Description | Created from | Field type|
|-------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
|id|the primary key for this model, used to cross reference Result objects|Django|Primary Key|
|pipeline_name|the name the user gives to the pipeline|User|Charfield|
|pipeline_des|the description the user inputs to identify the pipeline|User|Charfield|
|start_date|what date the pipeline will start looking for images|User|Date|
|end_date|what date the pipeline will stop looking for images|User|Date|
|interval|the interval period set by the user|User|Charfield (choice of 5)|
|aoi|the coordinates for the Area of Interest chosen by the user|User|JSON|
|output_image|the type of images the pipeline should return|User|Charfield (choice of 6)|
|cloud_cover|the maximum allowable cloud cover in returned images|User|Charfield|
|num_intervals|the number of intervals between the start and end date|API|Charfield|
|date_created|the date the pipeline was created|Spaceport|Date|
|aoi_area|the area in km2 of the AOI|API|Charfield|
|created_by|the user the pipeline was created by|Spaceport|Charfield|
|status|whether the pipeline is active, complete, or pending|Spaceport|Charfield|
|api_id|the unique id given to the pipeline by the API|API|Charfield|
|num_results|the number of results associated with the pipeline (same as num_intervals)|Spaceport|Charfield|
|num_images|the number of images successfully received by the pipeline|Spaceport|Charfield|
|results_updated|when the pipeline was last refreshed from the API|API|Datetime|
|featured_image|a url to display an image on My Pipelines page|API|Charfield|
|time_edited|when the pipeline was last edited|Spaceport|Datetime|


##### Result
- The Result model contains information about results relating to the pipeline.  The number of results for a pipeline is directly linked to the number of intervals a pipeline has. Example: if a pipeline is 5 days in length, with an interval of 1 day, there will be 5 intervals (1 for each day), and thus 5 results.
- It contains the List as the foreign key.
- The model fields are as below: 

| Field | Description | Created from | Field type|
|-------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
|id|the primary key for the results model0|Django|Primary Key|
|pipeline_id|the id from the List model|Django|Foreign Key|
|created_at|the time & date the result was created|API|Datetime|
|updated_at|the time & date the result was updated from the API|Spaceport|Datetime|
|api_pipeline_id|the unique API id of the pipeline|API|Charfield|
|output_id|the id from the API given to reference each output type|API|Charfield|
|status|the status of the result|Spaceport|Charfield|
|message|the message from the API for the result|API|Charfield|
|interval_start_date|the start date for this result|Spaceport|Date|
|interval_end_date|the end date for this result|Spaceport|Date|

## Style
The styling is kept clean and minimal throughout the site.  As the content of the site may appear technically complex to new users, there are no distracting fonts, colours or images to confound the user. Attractive images are used where relevant to pique the interest of the user and indicate, alongside the text, the purpose of the website.

### Wireframes
Initial wireframes were designed during the project proposal stage.

Homepage
My Pipelines
Create Account
Create Pipeline

### Font
The font style is the default Bootstrap 5 native sans-serif font stack for cross platform usability. The font remains consistent throughout the website, aside from being rendered in italic or font style for emphasis.

![Bootstrap Native Font](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643901837/Spaceport/font_xbuoff.jpg)

### Colours
- The colours of the website are kept to basic white, black and a light blue/grey background colour (rgb(177, 177, 177)).

![Main background colour](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643900779/Spaceport/177177177_tt8ngq.jpg)

- A similar blue/grey hue is used in table headings (#5c6885). 

![Table headings](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643900779/Spaceport/92104133_v295zu.jpg)
![Results table](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902229/Spaceport/tableheadings_gulfv8.jpg)

- Form field validation is noticeable against these similar colours with a pink/orange hue to raise attention. 
![Form field invalid](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643900779/Spaceport/250209185_zrohcm.jpg) 
![Form field not filled in](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902229/Spaceport/invalidform_wrirn0.jpg)

- The form progress panel uses an unremarkable turquoise (#04aa6d) to show the user's form progress.
![Progress indicator](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643900779/Spaceport/4170109_euap9y.jpg)
![Progress indicator](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902228/Spaceport/progressindicator_ty89po.jpg)


- The high definition photos provide splashes of colour against a simple background.

![Image next to text](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902011/Spaceport/images_yckrmm.jpg)

### Layout
- The informative pages, such as the Homepage and Discover page, remain consistent with attractive images alongside short sections of text.

- Bootstrap cards are used to display information in a clear and concise manner along with a complementary image. 

![Discover Card](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643900948/Spaceport/card2_ocaal8.jpg)

- For several pages, the content is rendered in a section of white background with a box-shadow in front of the normal light blue background.

![Form with box shadow](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902342/Spaceport/boxshadow_owigi7.jpg)

- Most pages offer a sub navigation list to easily jump to the relevant section of the page.

![Sub navigation on Pipelines page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643901899/Spaceport/nav1_nwz0ix.jpg)

- For longer pages, a 'Back to Top' type button is fixed in the bottom right corner to allow users to scroll up to the top of the page.

## Scope

### Site User Stories

## User Stories Strategy
Epics were defined based on the main functions the website was expected to have, which mostly revolved around the main CRUD functions of the database.  These Epics were refined into smaller User Stories, which could then be broken down into manageable tasks for the developer to complete within the current project iteration.  See all [project iterations/boards](https://github.com/MojosBeans100/ms4-spaceport/projects).

The User Stories were designated a priority label to complete within the iteration.  The main CRUD functions were assigned a 'must-have' label.  User Stories which were deemed beneficial but not a priority were assigned a 'should-have' label.

All User Stories which were not completed had a 'could-have' label assigned to them, updated to 'won't-have' at final deployment, as they were additional features which did not affect the main functionality of the website. These User Stories could be completed if there was an opportunity for another iteration for this project.

- 5.9 As a **New/returning Site User** I can **read about common applications of satellite imagery** so that **I have more understanding of the real life applications of the website**

## User Story 6
As a **Site User** I can **calculate the probability of my pipeline** so that **I can see what the chances are of successful results, and change my parameters if required**

- 6.1: As a **Site User** I can **view the probability of each interval returning an image** so that **I can see the percentage chance of receiving an image**
- 6.2: As a **Site User** I can **view the reason as to why the probability percentage is low** so that **I know which parameters I could change to attempt to increase the probability percentage**
- 6.3: As a **Site User** I can **return back to previous form tabs and adjust my parameters** so that **I can attempt to increase the chance of probability**
- 6.4: As a **Site User** I can **re-calculate the probability percentage** so that **I can understand how my form changes have changed the probability percentage**

User Story 6 was not implemented in the final deployed project, and was therefore not tested.

The Skywatch API allows users to [calculate the probability](https://api-docs.skywatch.co/#tag/pipelinePost) (%) that each interval will return an image.  This is based on the API's algorithm which will match up the AOI with a suitable satellite, as well as meteorology reports.  For example, an interval may only have a 40% chance of returning an image because there is excessive cloud cover forecast that day.  The user can then adjust their interval settings or cloud cover parameters to attempt to increase this percentage.

In a testing environment this feature was set up with a Javascript async *fetch* function to call the API with the user's chosen parameters, and the resulting probability numbers displayed on the Review page of the Create a Pipeline form.  The user could scroll back through the form tabs to adjust their form field values, and the probability would then re-calculate for the new parameters.  These probability percentage figures would not be stored in a model.

While the function worked as expected in the testing environment, the feature was not included in the final deployed project due to time restraints.  The User Story was a 'could-have' issue, and omitting this feature does not hamper the user's experience on the website.


## User Story 7
As a **Site User** I can **save an incomplete form** so that **I can return to the form in the future for committing**

- 7.1: As a **Site User** I can **save an incomplete form** so that **I can keep the parameters saved without having to commit**
- 7.2: As a **Site User** I can **see my saved pipelines on my My Pipelines page** so that **I know how many forms I have part-completed and are still to be completed**
- 7.3: As a **Site User** I can **click on one of my saved pipelines** so that **I can return to the incomplete form and continue working on it**
- 7.4: As a **Site User** I see **my saved pipeline parameters filled in on the Create a Pipeline form** so that **I don't have to input these again**

User Story 7 was not implemented in the final deployed project, and was therefore not tested.

An additional button could be added to the form on all tabs which would save the object, but not submit the pipeline parameters to the API.  The object would appear on the My Pipelines page under a new status category 'Saved Pipelines'.  When opened, the form would open with form fields filled in with any information the user had already input.

This feature could be implemented easily on another iteration of the project. While this feature may be beneficial, especially as the form is relatively long, it is not a feature which affects the overall functionality of the website.

## User Story 8
As a **Website Owner/Admin** I can **lock/restrict specific parameters in the admin panel** so that **for certain users I can control the details of the pipelines they submit**

User Story 8 was not implemented in the final deployed project, and was therefore not tested. 

The purpose of this feature was to allow the admin panel to restrict certain parameters for users.  For example, the admin could determine that one user could only access AOIs of 5,000 km2 as opposed to 10,000 km2.  

It became more evident throughout the development of the project that this feature would only be beneficial for purchased imagery, and adding restrictions for free data would further reduce the probability of the user receiving images for their pipelines. The developer felt it was more beneficial to allow users full scope of the free API data.

## User Story 9
As a **Site User** I can **see a visual graph of the progress of the pipeline** so that **I have a more visually pleasing understanding of the pipeline progress** (active pipelines only)

- 9.1: As a **Site User** I can **see a timeline spanning the full duration of my pipeline** so that **I can see when the pipeline starts and ends**
- 9.2: As a **Site User** I can **see a legend on the timeline** so that **I know what all icons and colours represent**
- 9.3: As a **Site User** I can **see all intervals in my pipeline** so that **I know when the intervals start, end, and the duration**
- 9.4: As a **Site User** I can **see the status of all pipelines colour-coded** so that **I can see which intervals have been completed, and which are still to be completed**

# Features

## Homepage
The Spaceport homepage presents the purpose of the website to the user in a clear and concise manner, with attractive images and minimalist design.

### Navbar
The navigation bar at the top of the webpage is featured on all pages, and remains fixed at the top in order for the user to be able to navigate to other pages easily, demonstrate the page the user is on, and provide a general overview of the website content.  The content of the navigation bar changes depending on the user's log in state in order to reflect the relevant pages.

To the left is the website title and featured icon.  The user can use either of these to navigate back to the homepage.
Offset from the left is a collection of other pages - Discover, Create and Pipelines - the latter two of which are only available for signed up and logged in users.
Fixed to the right is the link to login/signup/logout, for the user to change their login state.  If the user is logged in their username is also displayed here, clearly showing they are logged in. 

The navigation bar links are underlined to show the active page and also display this style on mouse hover.  The navigation bar responds to smaller screens by removing all links aside from the homepage link and icon, placing these in a drop down bar.

### Banner image
The homepage image is chosen specifically because of the attractive colours and content.  It displays an imaging satellite and in the background is a high resolution render of Earth taken from space, both of which are of most relevance to the purpose of the website.  Alongside this image is a concise website description - "Access satellite imagery in minutes" - to further reinforce the purpose of the website, and demonstrate the simplicity of the process of creating a pipeline.

![Website banner](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643902011/Spaceport/images_yckrmm.jpg)
Website banner image

### Introduction to website
The rest of the homepage attempts to capture the concept of the website in a concise and understandable way, by explaining in four simple steps what their experience using the website will be - simply put, to choose an area on Earth, allow the platform to set up their pipeline and await results, continually track the progress, and ultimately view and use the collected images.

![Website introduction](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643905166/Spaceport/introtowebsite_ae4xtz.jpg)
One of the four steps

### Calls to action
After reading the website introduction, the user is directed to either the Discover page or (if logged in) to create a pipeline, or (if not logged in) create an account.  This section is designed to encourage the user to either learn more about satellite imagery and pipelines, namely for new users, or if they are returning they can move directly to creating a pipeline.

Homepage calls to action

[Back to top](#spaceport)

## Discover
The Discover page is named aptly to encourage users to explore more about satellite imagery before jumping in to creating their own pipelines.  The purpose of the page is to provide more technical information and context about the site's purpose.  This information is kept separate from the homepage as it holds a lot of information, and the user is directed to this page at several places on other pages, as the developer feels it is beneficiary to explore this page before using the site.  In short, as the website is based on a very specific, technical concept, the developer wants the user to have a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of the site. 

![Discover banner](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643905293/Spaceport/discover_fzkqjq.jpg)
Discover banner

### Discover links
As the Discover page is long, a sub navigation section is rendered to display the information the user can expect to find on this page, and to allow the user to jump to the page section of most interest.

![Discover links](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352074/discover_fcnifx.jpg)

### Applications
The applications section of the Discover page convey to the user the industry uses of satellite imagery.  This section is intended to provide the user with more context to the site's purpose.  The section details three common uses of satellite imagery, with a relevant image and short description attached to each use. 

![Discover applications](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352074/discoerapplications_oseaq0.jpg)

### Examples
The examples section is an extension of the applications section, explaining in more detail an example of how and why satellite imagery is collected.  These 'real-life' examples provide context to the user about why they might want to use the site.

![Discover examples](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352073/discoverexamples_yfpc52.jpg)

### News
The news section further reinforces the importance of access to satellite imagery, providing a couple of topical examples which the user may have recently come across to provoke the user's interest.

![Discover news](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352074/discovernews_kjzkto.jpg)

### Glossary
The glossary section defines any technical or unfamiliar terms the user may come across on the site, with images where applicable.

![Discover glossary](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352073/discoverglossary_pcax4x.jpg)

### FAQ
The frequently asked questions section provides access to some questions the user may ask when using the site, and attempts to provide a clear answer.

![Discover FAQ](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352074/discoverfaq_criutz.jpg)

## Pipelines
The Pipelines/My Pipelines page lists all the pipelines the user has created.  This page can be used to review the status of current pipelines, and click on each to see the detailed view.

### Pipelines links
There is a sub navigation section which categorises the pipelines by their status.  There is also a brief description beneath each link to convey what each status means in the context of satellite imagery pipelines.

![Pipeline links](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352269/pipelineslinks_zqm1wm.jpg)

### Pipelines cards
Each pipeline is represented by a Bootstrap card, identified by the name of the pipeline.  The description, start and end dates, number of images collected, and a link to view the pipeline detail are also displayed.  The latest image the pipeline has collected is displayed in the card, or a placeholder image if there are none.

![Pipeline cards](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352269/pipelinecards_uquq6c.jpg)

[Back to top](#spaceport)

## Detail
The detail view of the pipeline displays all information about the pipeline object.  The user can view not only the parameters they set, but information the platform gathers about intervals, and any results created.  The information is ordered specifically to render the identifying information first, then the information of most interest to the user (intervals/results), then the information the user already knows (the parameters selected by the user).

### Calls to action
There are two calls to action at the top of the page.  One to navigate back to the user's list of all pipelines.  The second calls the 'Update' function, which is placed at the top of the page in the immediate view of the user as it is an important function.  User's must update their pipelines manually, reasons for which are outlined in the 'Limitations' section of this document.  The time of the last update is rendered beneath this button.

![Detail CTAs](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352504/detailctas_hejxin.jpg)

### General
The general section conveys the most important, identifying and summarising information about the pipeline - the name, status, AOI, date created and number of images collected.  The AOI is displayed in a map, which automatically locates to the area and renders the user's drawn area.

![Detail general](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352506/detailgeneral_hk8rch.jpg)

### Interval
The interval section provides a table of all intervals in the pipeline, colour coded to represent the status of that interval (current, complete, future) and if they successful in collecting an image.  The overall start and end dates of the pipeline are also rendered, as well as the interval period (1d/daily, 7d/weekly etc) and number of intervals.

If the pipeline is active, a timeline graph is shown to provide a visual representation of the interval table data.  This timeline is not displayed under a screen width of 1200px.  As this information is duplicated in the interval table, albeit in a less visually appealing way, the omitting of the timeline below certain screen sizes should not hamper the user's experience on the site and understanding of the progress of their pipeline. 

![Detail intervals](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352505/detailinterval_wcxhi7.jpg)

### Results
The pipeline results are also displayed in a table.  The user can see:

- the status of the interval
- dates of the interval the result relates to
- an selectable image which opens a separate tab showing a preview of the image
- the time the image was captured by the satellite
- the satellite the image was captured by
- a link to the metadata which opens a separate tab displaying technical data of the image in JSON format 

The user can expand the table by clicking the drop down, which will open all rows to display further technical data about the image, as well as a link which downloads the full size image.

![Detail results](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352506/detailresult_vkk012.jpg)

### Parameters
The parameters the user selected are displayed towards the bottom of the detail page for the user to review.

![Detail parameters](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352504/detialparameters_y0nmxu.jpg)

### Edit/Delete
The edit/delete functions are display in buttons, as well as information about when the pipeline was last update, and if it cannot be updated.

![Detail edit/delete](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352504/detailedit_s7cimj.jpg)

## Create a Pipeline
The 'Create a Pipeline' form is an interactive form divided into multiple tabs, so the user can progress and regress as they need.  Each tab represents different categories in the form, as well as a definition of the parameters being asked, restrictions, and visual aids if required.  The form concludes with a review section, for the user to review all the parameters they set.

### Intro Page
The introduction page on the form describes the purpose of the form, as well as prompting the user to visit the 'Discover' page if they are new.  A short sub navigation is provided on this page for convenience to scroll through the sections.

#### How it works
The users are provided with a short and punchy three step process of creating a pipeline.

![How it works](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352867/createintrohow_n5poww.jpg)

#### Restrictions
The restrictions in terms of setting up their pipeline are displayed here, so the user knows to expect these in the form.  These are repeated on the relevant form section. 

![Restrictions](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352867/createintrotres_ceetxc.jpg)

#### Satellite Acquisition
The user is provided with some advice on how to maximise their chance of receiving an image, as well as ensuring the user understands that not all pipelines deliver results, depending on if a suitable satellite was found for their pipeline. 

![Satellite aquisition](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352867/createintrosate_fjdfm4.jpg)

#### AOI Selection
A map is used to select the AOI, so a basic set of instructions of drawing an area are provided to the user with pictures.

![AOI selection](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352867/createaoiselection_aw2vvs.jpg)

#### Getting Started
Users are provided with some suggestions of what kind of pipeline to create.  This is to give new users especially a starting point for creating a pipeline.

![Pipeline ideas](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644352867/createintrogetting_stetcq.jpg)

### General Page
The general section requires the user to input a name for their pipeline and they can also provide a short description to further identify it if required.

![General form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884237/Spaceport/general_go11c0.jpg)

### AOI Page
The AOI section requires the users to use the interactive map to select points to form a polygon.  The definition and restrictions of AOI are provided.  The user is given feedback on the size of AOI they chose.

![AOI form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884237/Spaceport/aoi_huwk3g.jpg)

### Interval Page
The interval section asks the users to select their pipeline start and end date, and the interval in which to capture images.  The restrictions of the interval, and validation errors are also on this page.

![Interval form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884434/Spaceport/interval_yxaofq.jpg)

### Parameters Page
Users can adjust the cloud cover settings if they wish.  Visual representations of low, medium and high cloud cover are provided for reference.  If the form field is left at the default value of 1%, they are allowing images to be delivered with any percentage of cloud cover.

![Cloud cover form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884518/Spaceport/cloudcover_izmve7.jpg)

### Output Page
Users can select from six output image types, set to a default of True Colour type.  Users can hover over the image to see a description of what the image type is. 

![Output form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884848/Spaceport/output_zhmmfz.jpg)

### Review Page
Users can review all the parameters they set. They have the option to submit the pipeline, or go back and adjust parameters.  They are encouraged to review all the details before they submit. 

![Review form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643884982/Spaceport/review_dynivc.jpg)

### Submitting Page
The last form page presents a loading screen to the user, to let the user know the pipeline has been submitted and is being set up.  There are no calls to action on this page.

![Submitting form page](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1643885204/Spaceport/submitting_dajpkl.jpg)

[Back to top](#spaceport)

## Edit Pipeline
The name and parameters* of pipelines can be edited if the pipeline is active.  At the very end of the detail view of the pipeline, there is an 'Edit' section.

![Edit pipeline form](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644438014/editform_byhf16.jpg)

*this is an API restriction, only allowing these two parameters to be changed once committed, aside from the parameters documented [here](#edit-pipeline-1)

## Delete Pipeline
Users can also delete their pipelines via the 'Delete' button in the detail view of the pipeline.

![Delete pipeline](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644438181/delete_en0mhy.jpg)

Users can see confirmation that their pipeline has been deleted.

# Technologies Used

## HTML/CSS
The project uses [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) language to build the website pages.
[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) is used to style the pages.

## Javascript
[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) is included on most pages.  The main functions are:

### Display a 'Back to Top' button
On pages which have a lot of content, the user is provided with a button to allow them to scroll back to the top of the page for convenience.  This is [external library code](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp).

### Highlight the website active page
The three selectable pages in the navigation bar display different styling when the page is active.

### Create a map to draw the AOI
*function createMap()*

In the Create a Pipeline form, JS code renders a Mapbox map of the world and allows users to select points to form a polygon for choosing their AOI.

The code is derived from the 'draw' function in [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-draw/).

### Render the map to review the AOI
*function reviewMap() & function detailMap()*

Reviewing the map requires a reverse function of the above, collecting the user's selected AOI in geoJSON format and drawing this on the map.

The code is derived from the 'addSource' function in [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map#addsource).

### Create a progressive form to create a pipeline
For improved UX, the Create a Pipeline form is seperated into relevant tabs to allow the user to move forwards and back as desired.  The form provides additional form field validation.

The code is derived from [W3S](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_form_steps.asp), adapted and enhanced to fit the requirements of the project.

### Perform form field validation
*function validateCloudCover(), function validateDate()*

Additional validation methods are required for the form, aside from the above and Django Forms validation. The user is provided with inline feedback for their parameters, so they are aware if and why they are valid/invalid.  The two main uses of this are to validate the interval dates and the AOI size.

### Create form review
*function createReview()*

This function renders the pipeline parameters as a final step for the user to review before submitting.  

### Create a chart to shown a timeline of the pipeline
*function timelineChart()*

This function creates a ChartJS graph, displaying relevant pipeline dates in a more visually appealing manner.

The code is derived from a simple example from the ChartJS [documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html).


## Python


## Django
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is the framework used in this project
- The Django templating language was used to render pages
- The Django [unit test library](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/overview/) was used for unit tests

## APIs
Two APIs were implemented into the project.

### Skywatch
The Skywatch API provides access to satellite data.  The full scope of the API can be found [here](https://api-docs.skywatch.co/). 

A secret key was required to access the API.  This secret key is found in the eny.py file, and therefore is never committed to Github.   The secret key was also input to the Confiv Vars in Heroku for the deployed site.  The same secret key is used for each user on the site. 

The account was limited to a developer's account, and therefore only free data is accessible. This limits the parameters of the API to only return free images.  The form fields in the Create a Pipeline form validate the values strenuously to ensure users cannot access purchased imagery. 

The API is very in-depth and there are many [additional features](#additional-features) which the developer could add to the project on another iteration.

### Mapbox
The Mapbox API was used to render the selectable map for the user to draw an AOI.  This uses a public key, as it is only the 'free' version.  This public key is also set in the env.py file and input to the Confiv Vars in Heroku. 

There are also many [additional features](#additional-features) which could be added to this map feature.

[Back to top](#spaceport)

# Testing
The testing strategy is detailed in [this document](TESTING.md).

# Additional Features
This section details some additional features which could be added to further develop the website.

## UX
- Map zoom
Additional code could be added to the map renders, to create a short zoom animation towards their AOI

- Map layers
Users could select which kind of terrain would be most useful to display on the map - ie street map, geographical, topology.

- Map search
Mapbox has features which would allow users to add into a search box a location (eg New York) and the map would zoom to that location.  Additionally, once the AOI has been selected, reverse Geocoding can find an approximate location.  This could be added as a field into the pipeline (List) object.

## User Features

### Default pipelines
Several 'public' pipelines could be added which all users would have access to when they initially create an account  with Spaceport.  The developer feels it would be beneficial to see some 'live' examples of one active, complete, and pending pipeline, as well as an successful and unsuccessful pipeline.  

This would allow them to peruse these pipelines in order to understand the concept better, before they create their own.  

In reality this may be tricky to manage in terms of what access they have in terms of editing, updating and deleting, moreover there would be complexities with the API model being accessible by more than one person.  

### Save incomplete pipeline
A feature could be added within the code to allow users to save an incomplete pipeline form and return to it at a later date.  The developer feels this would be a useful feature, as the Create a Pipeline form is lengthy, and the user may want to refer back to the Discover page (Glossary, FAQs) during the completion of the form.

### Copy pipeline
This feature would allow users to copy an 'active' or 'complete' pipeline and render these details into a new form which could be submitted as a new object.  This may be useful for users whose pipeline was unsuccessful and they'd like to modify a few parameters, or if they want to create more than 10 intervals for that pipeline. 

### Edit pipeline
The Edit form for changing parameters of the pipeline can be extended. 

The API does allow to 'patch' the AOI, ie add or remove from the AOI.  This is a complex function, and was not explored during the development of the project. 

The pipeline status can also be changed to allow the user to 'deactivate' the pipeline, ie when it is 'active', set it to 'inactive'.  This is an insignificant function for the project, as it is only practical for purchased imagery.

### Pipelines update automatically
The code could be improved by updating pipelines automatically, either via a timed request every few hours to update all pipelines in the database, or updating automatically when the pipeline detail view is selected.  In order to limit the number of API calls and maintain a responsive website, users can update individual pipelines manually.  Furthermore, the details of pipelines do not change dramatically on an hour to hour basis, therefore while an automatic update may be more convenient, it is not a necessity.

Similarly, when the user has created a new pipeline, there is a short period while the API gathers the information before the pipeline can be created.  In order to avoid the user being 'stuck' on a loading screen for five minutes, user experience is greater when they are directed straight to the detail view and instructed to wait a few minutes then update themselves.

### Upload AOI in different format
In order to provide an accessible, user friendly selection of the AOI, a map feature is rendered to allow the user to select their AOI in a polygon shape.  There are instances whereby this is not the most effective selection technique. The user may wish to select a very specific area which is based on geographical features which are not rendered in detail on a map. 

For example: if the user would like to pick an AOI based on a very specific section of forest area, the forestry commision or land owner can provide a digital file containing the coordinates of the area, as opposed to what may be a very fiddly process of selecting this area on the map.  In this instance, a preferred method may be to upload a .KML or .geoJSON file. 

The form could be improved by giving the user the choice to either select from the map, or upload a file.  The AOI file would have to be read, verified and validated in terms of AOI size and the JSON format before proceeding (this could be done with a separate API, DjangoJSON, or via Skywatch itself.)  

### Additional model to include API key
The API key used to create all pipelines references the developer's own account with Skywatch.  The Sign Up form could include a field to allow users to input their own API key.  This feature would be more practical for users who are already in the satellite imagery industry, and own an account with Skywatch.  For the purposes of this project, this feature did not seem necessary.

## API
The Skywatch API is very in-depth and there are many additional technical parameters which could be added to explore it further (dependent on the scope of the developer's account with Skywatch). See the [Skywatch API documentation](https://api-docs.skywatch.co/) for more information. 

### Latency
Latency describes the acceptable number of days between interval end date and delivery of the image.   The latency is currently set to the full interval period to increase the probability of image delivery. As an example: if the user chooses an interval of 1 week, and one of the interval start and end dates are 1st Jan 22 and 7th Jan 22 respectively,  images can be delivered in the week after that interval i.e. 8th Jan 22 to 15th Jan.  The images are still captured within the specified interval; the latency refers to the acceptable delivery dates. 

Users may desire to change this, and only accept images if they can be delivered within the interval itself, but they would have to have specific reasons to do so, and this did not seem relevant for the purposes of the project.

The technical understanding behind why there is this latent period of delivery is determined by how frequently satellites communicate with ground stations.  A satellite may capture an image of the AOI within the interval, but does not pass over a ground station for a few days afterwards.

A simplistic representation of this is shown [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/code-institute-mojos-beans/image/upload/v1644147808/latency2_rbelk3.png).

### Resolution
The resolution for all images is set to 'low' (8 - 15 metres).  The Skywatch account of the developer is limited to this resolution so as to only allow delivery of free images.  A feature could be added to allow users to refine this (for example, to between 8 and 9 metres), but this did not seem advantageous or relevant for the website, and would further reduce the probability of receiving an image.

### AOI Coverage
For Spaceport users, the AOI coverage is set to a minimum of 50%, therefore only images which have covered at least 50% of the AOI selected will be delivered.  An additional tab on the Create a Pipeline form could allow for the user to control this parameter and accept images with lesser coverage, or only accept images with higher coverage.

### Alternative Images
Taking into account the AOI Coverage parameter as above, a feature could allow users to view alternative images with an AOI coverage of below their selected percentage.  For example, if the AOI coverage is set to 50%, there may be 10 images found which captured less than 50% of the AOI.  This feature would allow users to still view these images as they may still be of use.

### Mosaicking
Mosaicking is a term which essentially means 'stitching' together images taken at different times or from different satellites.  If this feature was allowed, this would increase the probability of an interval delivering an image.  This parameter is not permitted to be changed under the developer's account.

# Unfixed Bugs

## Remove email address from Sign Up Form
Users can sign up to the website using a username and password.  During deployment there was an error related to the email address field as this required some back-end settings to work properly.  

The details about setting this up were not included in the course materials for the current project, nor was the email field specified in the user authentication project requirements, therefore the username input alone was deemed acceptable for the purposes of the project. 

Users are strongly encouraged to note their sign-in details, as without email there is no password recovery available.

## Dates on pipeline timeline
The developer feels the timeline of the interval dates in the pipeline detail view would be improved only showing dates on the x axis where there is a data point, ie an interval start or end date, or image captured date.  This would appear cleaner and clearer to the user.  The 'autoskip' function on the ChartJS timeline should perform this function - to only render data points on the axis - but could not be displayed the way the developer desired.  After some tutor support, this bug was left unfixed since although the timeline was a bit clunky, it did not show incorrect information.
