# Spaceport
Spaceport is a full stack website which allows users to access satellite imagery of the Earth.  Users can create a tasking pipeline which will deliver images of the specified area when they are available.  The website was developed for Milestone 4 as part of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Developement.

# Project Overview
- This website was developed for submission as the Milestone 4 project of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Developement.
- The website is deployed using the Heroku pages at the following url:
- The repository on Github that contains the website source code and assets is available at the following url:
- The website was built with a responsive look and feel, designed to be enjoyable to use on all screen sizes.

# Definitions
This website is based on a technical concept of access satellite imagery, therefore see below some useful definitions which may be used in this document.
These definitions can also be found on the Discover website page.
- Pipeline: a pipeline refers to the timeline, or projected plan, of receiving satellite images. Each object in the 'List' model represents a pipeline.  Pipelines are active if they have not completed all intervals, and complete if all intervals have been completed
- Interval:

# UX
## Strategy
### Site User
The primary goals of the website user are as follows:
- To create an account on the website, which will allow them to create pipelines
- To create, update, edit and delete pipelines 
- To view the details of a pipeline they have created
- To view the schedule of receiving images
- To see a list of all their pipelines, ordered by status
- To understand the applications and purposes of satellite imagery
